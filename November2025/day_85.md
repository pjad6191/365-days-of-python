## November 1, 2025 - Day 85

### What I Worked On:  
**Exercism**
- Finished an exercise dealing with creating a class object "SpaceAge" to determine the age in years someone would be on each planet.
- Finished up the learning portion of Exercism with generator functions. I have never worked with generator functions, so it took me a little bit of time to get the hang of it. Regardless of the fact that it was new, I did not seek outside help. I figured it out on my own. 

**Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**
- Finally finished the last problem set from this class!
  
### Concepts Practiced:  
- Object oriented programming
- Generator functions
         
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
- [Problem 5](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/resources/ps5/)
