### What I Worked On:
**Exercism:**  
I wrote code that created a Queen object for chess given its coordinates on an 8x8 array, and then determine if this Queen could attack another Queen. I feel proud of myself with this program. It was not that I accomplished a difficult task, but it was that I was able to create the Queen object and write another function that used the object and interacted with another object. It may seem minor, but I was not comfortable with OOP at first. I am finally getting to the point where it is feeling comfortable. I was able to write this code easily and didn't have to debug it. 

### Concepts Practiced:  
- OOP: Classes & methods
- Arrays
- raise ValueError 
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
class Queen:
    def __init__(self, row, column):

        # if the row parameter is negative
        if row < 0:
            raise ValueError("row not positive")
            
        # if the row parameter is not on the defined board
        if row >= 8:
            raise ValueError("row not on board")
            
        # if the column parameter is negative
        if column < 0:
            raise ValueError("column not positive")
            
        # if the column parameter is not on the defined board
        if column >= 8:
            raise ValueError("column not on board")
            
        self.row = row
        self.column = column 

    def can_attack(self, another_queen):
        if self.row == another_queen.row and self.column == another_queen.column:
            raise ValueError("Invalid queen position: both queens in the same square")
        if self.row == another_queen.row:
            return True
        if self.column == another_queen.column:
            return True 
        if abs(self.column - another_queen.column) == abs(self.row - another_queen.row):
            return True 
        return False 
```
