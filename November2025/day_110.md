## November 26, 2025 - Day 110

### What I Worked On:
**Exercism:**  
I wrote code that created a phone number object. The numbers needed to be cleaned up and formatted appropriately for use in the system. It also needed to deal with filtering out any invalid entries. The instructions required a lot of raise ValueError messages. 

One issue I have with Exercism is that the instructions are not always thorough enough. I didn't see any instructions that said to explicitly create an area code variable or have a "pretty print" function, so I failed these tests initially. I only knew they were needed once I failed the tests. I think the instructions need to be more clear on the requirements so that I can work on creating code that will pass the first time. 


 
### Concepts Practiced:  
- OOP: Classes & methods
- Cleaning strings
- raise ValueError 
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
class PhoneNumber:
    def __init__(self, number):

        # Create a variable for the output
        digits = ""

        # Check for letters and punctuation to raise errors and add only the digits to the output
        for char in str(number):
            if char.isalpha():
                raise ValueError("letters not permitted")
            elif char.isdigit():
                digits += char
            elif char in "()+-. ":
                # This punctuation is allowed
                continue
            else:
                # Raise error for any other non-digit, non-letter, non-formatting char
                raise ValueError("punctuations not permitted")

        # Raise errors for length
        if len(digits) < 10:
            raise ValueError("must not be fewer than 10 digits")
        if len(digits) > 11:
            raise ValueError("must not be greater than 11 digits")

        # Raise error if country code does not start with 1
        if len(digits) == 11:
            if not digits.startswith("1"):
                raise ValueError("11 digits must start with 1")
            # Remove the "1" country code 
            digits = digits[1:]

        # Get area code and exchange code 
        area_code = digits[0:3]
        exchange_code = digits[3:6]

        # Raise errors for area codes
        if area_code[0] == "0":
            raise ValueError("area code cannot start with zero")
        if area_code[0] == "1":
            raise ValueError("area code cannot start with one")

        # Raise errors for exchange codes
        if exchange_code[0] == "0":
            raise ValueError("exchange code cannot start with zero")
        if exchange_code[0] == "1":
            raise ValueError("exchange code cannot start with one")

        # Assign cleaned numbers
        self.number = digits
        self.area_code = area_code


    def pretty(self):
        return f"({self.area_code})-{self.number[3:6]}-{self.number[6:]}"
```
