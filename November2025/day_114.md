## November 30, 2025 - Day 114

### What I Worked On:
**Exercism:**  
I wrote code that implemented a simple robot simulator that moves on a 2D grid. The robot starts at a given (x, y) coordinate, faces one of four directions (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST), and responds to a stream of movement instructions (right, left, advance). I feel like these instructions were the worst yet though. 

### Concepts Practiced:  
- Array
- 2D Grid
- Conditionals
- OOP
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
# Globals for the directions
NORTH = "NORTH"
EAST  = "EAST"
SOUTH = "SOUTH"
WEST  = "WEST"

DIRECTIONS = [NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST]

class Robot:
    def __init__(self, direction=NORTH, x_pos=0, y_pos=0):
        self.direction = direction
        self.x_pos = x_pos
        self.y_pos = y_pos

    @property
    def coordinates(self):
        return (self.x_pos, self.y_pos)

    def move(self, instructions):
        directions = DIRECTIONS

        current = self.direction
        i = directions.index(current)

        for char in instructions:
            if char == "R":
                # turn right
                i = (i + 1) % len(directions)
                current = directions[i]
            elif char == "L":
                # turn left
                i = (i - 1) % len(directions)
                current = directions[i]
            elif char == "A":
                # coordinates increase to the NORTH (+y) and EAST (+x)
                if current == NORTH:
                    self.y_pos += 1
                elif current == SOUTH:
                    self.y_pos -= 1
                elif current == EAST:
                    self.x_pos += 1
                elif current == WEST:
                    self.x_pos -= 1

        self.direction = current


```
