## November 18, 2025 - Day 102

### What I Worked On:  
**Exercism:**  
I created a function that returns how many times each word occurs in a subtitle. It was straightforward except for the fact that we needed to keep punctuation in the middle of the words such as in contractions, but if they occurred anywhere else, they needed to be removed. 
 
### Concepts Practiced:  
- String manipulation and cleaning
- Dictionaries
         
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
def count_words(sentence):
    """ 
    This function returns how many times each word occurs in a subtitle. 
    param: string
    return: dictionary of words and their word counts
    """
    
    import string

    # Get punction marks
    punctuation = string.punctuation 

    # Make sure all the letters are lowercase
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    
    # Remove all punctuation except apostrophes
    for char in punctuation:
        if char != "'" and char in sentence:
            sentence = sentence.replace(char, " ")

    # Split the words into a lit
    words = sentence.split()

    # Initialize a dictionary
    word_count = {}
        
    for w in words:
        # Strip apostrophes ONLY at edges
        w = w.strip("'")
        if not w:         
            continue
        if w in word_count:
            word_count[w] += 1
        else:
            word_count[w] = 1
        
    return word_count

```
