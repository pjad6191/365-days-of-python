## November 20, 2025 - Day 104

### What I Worked On:  
**Exercism:**  
I created a function that calculates the score for a given roll of dice in a game of Yacht.
 
### Concepts Practiced:  
- Conditionals
         
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
# Score categories.
# You can use any values you want, as long as you use them consistently.
YACHT = "YACHT"
ONES = "ONES"
TWOS = "TWOS"
THREES = "THREES"
FOURS = "FOURS"
FIVES = "FIVES"
SIXES = "SIXES"
FULL_HOUSE = "FULL_HOUSE"
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = "FOUR_OF_A_KIND"
LITTLE_STRAIGHT = "LITTLE_STRAIGHT"
BIG_STRAIGHT = "BIG_STRAIGHT"
CHOICE = "CHOICE"


def score(dice, category):
    """
    Calculates the score for a given roll of dice in the Yacht game.

    Param:
    dice : list[int] - A list of five integers (1–6) for each of the dice
    category : str - The scoring category to evaluate.

    Returns: int - The score for the roll according to the chosen category.

    for die in dice:
        counts[die] += 1

            score = 30

    elif category == BIG_STRAIGHT:
        if sorted(dice) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
            score = 30

    elif category == CHOICE:
        score = sum(dice)

    elif category == YACHT:

    return score
