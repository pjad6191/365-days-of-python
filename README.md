# 365-Days-of-Python

**Documenting my Python learning journey over 365 days.**

Over the next 365 days, I am committing to learning Python every day. While I already have a solid understanding of the basics, my goal is to deepen my knowledge, sharpen my skills, and explore areas like **data science** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. This repository will serve as my log to track daily progress, document what I‚Äôm learning, highlight key milestones, and share insights along the way.

I will also work on small projects and challenges to apply the concepts I learn and to push my problem-solving skills further. 

---

## üí° Key Goals:
- Improve my **problem-solving** skills in Python.
- Master core Python concepts: **loops**, **functions**, **OOP**, **algorithms**.
- Dive deep into **data science** and **AI**, with hands-on projects.
- Track progress consistently and reflect on learning each day.

## üèÜ Key Accomplishments:
- TBD ‚Äì will update as the journey progresses!
- **Day 1**: Set up repository and worked on a program for an MIT Open Courseware class that I'm working through. 
- **Day 5**: 
- **Day 10**:

## üìÇ Structure:
- **August Folder**: Starting point for my journey, starting with practicing basic programs and completing the Google Advaned Data Analytics program.
- **Daily Logs**: Each day will be documented in a new markdown file (e.g., `day_1.md`, `day_2.md`, etc.). Each log will include:
  - What I worked on
  - Concepts practiced
  - Example code

---

## ‚ö° Progress Tracking:
Each day will build on the last, with incremental improvements. I may also be documenting my reflections, the challenges I‚Äôve encountered, and how I overcame them along the way. This will serve as both a personal log and a resource for anyone looking to follow a similar learning path.

## üöÄ Let's Go!
The journey begins now. Follow along or start your own 365 days of learning Python!
