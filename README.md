# 🐍 365 Days of Python

Welcome to my journey of learning and building with Python, one day at a time.

---

## ✅ 100 Days Completed!

As of **November 16, 2025**, I’ve completed **100 days** of Python learning and coding! 🎉

---

### 🔹 What This Is

This repository documents my daily Python learning over the course of **365 days**. While I started with a solid foundation, my goal is to deepen my understanding, sharpen problem-solving skills, and explore advanced areas like **data science** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**.

Each day, I log what I’ve learned and practiced. Along the way, I also complete small projects and coding challenges to apply new concepts and push my skills further.

### 💡 Key Goals

- Strengthen **problem-solving** with Python
- Master core Python topics: **functions**, **loops**, **OOP**, **algorithms**
- Build real-world experience with **data science** and **AI**
- Maintain consistent progress and reflection through daily logs

---

### 🏆 Key Accomplishments

- **Day 1**: Set up the repository and started MIT’s *Intro to CS and Programming in Python*
- **Day 85**: Completed MIT’s course (final problem set submitted!)
- **Day 85**: Finished Exercism’s Python Learning Mode
- **Day 100**: 🎉 100 Days of Python Completed!

---

### 📈 Highlights So Far

- Completed beginner → intermediate projects
- Practiced key concepts: conditionals, loops, functions, data structures
- Strengthened algorithmic thinking (e.g. greedy, brute force)
- Worked with file handling, modules, and real datasets
- Began learning **pandas** for data analysis
- Started a **Neural Data Science** course

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `August2025/`: Starting point — basic practice and work from Google’s Advanced Data Analytics program
- `September2025/`, `October2025/`, `November2025/`: Continued daily progress
- Each folder contains markdown files like `day_1.md`, `day_2.md`, etc., including:
  - Tasks completed
  - Concepts practiced
  - Notes or reflections
  - Sample code

## ⚡ Progress Tracking

This log tracks steady, daily improvement. Posts may appear off by a day due to late commits, but I’ve stayed consistent with daily coding and reflection.
