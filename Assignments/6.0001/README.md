# MIT 6.0001 â€” Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python  
Semester Portfolio by Pamela Brown

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview  
This repository contains the complete set of programming assignments (problem-sets) created during the MIT 6.0001 course: *Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python*. The instructions for the problem sets can be found here: [MIT 6.0001 Assignments](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/assignments/)

The course is designed for students with little or no prior programming experience, with the aim to:  
- provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems
- enable students to feel justifiably confident in writing small programs to accomplish useful goals
- use Python 3.5 (or similar) as the teaching language for developing programming fundamentals.  

## ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s in This Repo  
- Problem sets (PSet 1 through PSet 5) completed during the semester  
  - My code implementations in Python, organized by problem set

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Learning Outcomes  
During this course, I developed and practiced:  
- Basic Python programming constructs: variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples  
- Algorithmic thinking: brute force, generate-and-test, bisection  
- Object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, polymorphism  
- Working with external data (RSS feeds), time zones, and filtering logic  
- Writing clean, modular code guided by specification and testing
