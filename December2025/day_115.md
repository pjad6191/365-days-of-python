## December 1, 2025 - Day 115

### What I Worked On:
**Exercism:**  
 I wrote a function that finds all Pythagorean triplets where the sum of a, b, and c equals a specific number, N. I came up with a solution but it timed out with big numbers, so I'll figure out the solution to that tomorrow. 

### Concepts Practiced:  
- Math 
- Loops
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
def triplets_with_sum(number):
    combos = []
    for a in range(1, number//3):
        for b in range(a+1, number//2):
            c = number - a - b
            if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                combos.append([a,b,c])
    return combos
```
