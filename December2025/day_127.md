### What I Worked On:
**Exercism:**   
I created an implementation of the Vigenère cipher. The Vigenère cipher is a simple substitution cipher.

### Concepts Practiced:  
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Strings
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism
import string
key_dict = {}
lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase
for index, char in enumerate(lowercase):
    key_dict[index] = char
    
```
