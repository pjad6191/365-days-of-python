## December 8, 2025 - Day 122

### What I Worked On:
**Exercism:**  
I had some time to work on an Exercism exercise today.   
I created code that returns the four plants assigned to a given student based on a garden diagram.
Each student receives two cups from the first row and two from the second row, determined by their alphabetical position in the class list. The plants method extracts the correct plant codes from the diagram and converts them into full plant names (Grass, Clover, Radishes, Violets).

### Concepts Practiced:  
- OOP
- Lists
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Exercism Code:
class Garden:
    PLANT_CODES ={"G":"Grass", "C":"Clover", "R":"Radishes", "V":"Violets"}

    def __init__(self, diagram, students=None):
        if students is None:
            self.students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet", "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"]
        else:
            self.students = sorted(students)

        self.diagram = diagram
        
    def plants(self, name):
        # split the two rows of the diagram
        lines = self.diagram.split("\n")
        row1 = lines[0]
        row2 = lines[1]

        # find where this student's cups start
        student_index = self.students.index(name)
        plant_index = student_index*2

        # get the four plant codes for this student
        student_plants = [row1[plant_index], 
                          row1[plant_index+1], 
                          row2[plant_index], 
                          row2[plant_index+1]]
        
        # translate codes to names
        for index,abb in enumerate(student_plants):
            student_plants[index] = Garden.PLANT_CODES[abb]

        return student_plants
```
