## December 25, 2025 - Day 139

### What I Worked On:
**Neural Data Science:**  
I worked on Reading Data Files with pandas.

### Concepts Practiced:  
- Pandas
- DataFrames
- Reading files
- glob
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Reading Data Files with pandas](https://neuraldatascience.io/b-ai-assisted/multi-data-files-1/)
  
### Code: 
```python
# read in three files from the data folder, whose names start with "s" and end in "csv"
# concatenate them into one dataframe
# write the result to a csv file

import pandas as pd
import glob

# read in all files that start with "s" and end with "csv"
# use glob to get a list of file names
# use a list comprehension to read in the files
# use the concat method to concatenate the dataframes
# use the to_csv method to write the result to a csv file

# get a list of file names
file_list = glob.glob('data/s*.csv')

# read in the files
df_list = [pd.read_csv(file) for file in file_list]

# concatenate the dataframes
df = pd.concat(df_list)

# write the result to a csv file
df.to_csv('data/combined_csv_files.csv', index=False)

# print the first 5 rows of the dataframe
df.head()

# Check that the dataframe has 30 rows and 3 columns
df.shape

# raise an error if the dataframe does not have 30 rows and 3 columns
assert df.shape == (30, 3), "The dataframe does not have 30 rows and 3 columns"

# create a slice of df that contains 29 rows, 
# then raise an error if the dataframe does not have 30 rows and 3 columns
df_slice = df.iloc[0:29]
assert df_slice.shape == (30, 3), "The dataframe does not have 30 rows and 3 columns"

# calculate mean rt for each participantID
df.groupby('participantID').mean()

# calculate mean rt for each participantID. Do not show the mean for trial
df.groupby('participantID').mean().drop(columns='trial')

# calculate mean for each participantID using the RT column
df.groupby('participantID')['RT'].mean()



```
