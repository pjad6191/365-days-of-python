### What I Worked On:
I am starting to feel a little burned out on this Python journey because I'm now at a point where none of the exercises in Exercism are easy to work on. They are all taking significant time and effort, and I don't have the time or energy to devote that at this point in time. However, I don't want to give up on my goal, so I'm going to take a step back and only do one or two Exercism problems a week. Today I looked at doing a couple problems on LeetCode. 

### Concepts Practiced:  
- Strings
    
### Resources Used:  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore)
  
### Code: 
```python
#Reverses a string in place
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s[:] = s[::-1]

#Returns the reverse of an integer
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        sign = -1
        if x > 0:
            sign = 1

        x = abs(x)

        reversed = int(str(x)[::-1]) * sign

        if reversed < -2**31 or reversed > 2**31 - 1:
            return 0

        return reversed

```
