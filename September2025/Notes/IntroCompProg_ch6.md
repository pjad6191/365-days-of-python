Date: 9/4/25

## 6.1 Testing
- Test suite - a collection of inputs that has a high likelihood of revealing bugs, yet does not take too long to run
  - Ideal: Partition the space of all possible inputs into subsets, then include one from each partition
- Partition - divide a set into a collection of subsets such that each element of the original set belongs to exactly one of the subsets
- Glass-box testing - Heuristics based on exploring paths through the code
- Black-box testing - Heuristics based on exploring paths through specification
