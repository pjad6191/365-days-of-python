## September 4, 2025 - Day 27

### What I Worked On:  
- I picked back up on the MIT Open Courseware class I was doing. I read 2 chapters in an online textbook, and watched a lecture. I also finished Problem Set 2 that I started a long time ago. All I needed to do was to finish a section that added hints. 
  
### Concepts Practiced:  
- Testing
- Debugging
- Exceptions
- Creating a program with multiple functions 
           
### What I Found Challenging:  
- Figuring out the logic on the function match_with_gaps that I had to do on my program. 

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Finished Problem Set 2  
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - Lecture 7](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/resources/lecture-7-testing-debugging-exceptions-and-assertions/)
- [Introduction to Computation and Programming in Python](https://dn720002.ca.archive.org/0/items/gate-2020-computer-science-and-technology-by-disha-experts/Introduction%20to%20Computation%20and%20Programming%20Using%20Python.pdf)
  
### Reflections/Insights:
- I want to finish that Python course, so I picked back up on it. Plus, I did a lot of work on problem set 2 a while ago. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue with the MIT class online. 

### Code:
