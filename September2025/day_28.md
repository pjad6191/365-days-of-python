## September 5, 2025 - Day 28

### What I Worked On:  
- I worked on Problem 1: Word Scores from Problem Set 3 from the MIT CS Class. The objective was to implement a function that calculates the score for a single word. The score for a word is the product of two components:
-   the sum of the point for letters in the word
-   either [7 * word_length - 3 * (n-word_length)] or 1, whichever value is greater, where:
  - word_length is the number of letters used in the word
  - n is the number of letters available in the current hand
- We are to use the scrabble_letter_values dictionary that was defined at the top of the program outline
  
### Concepts Practiced:  
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Testing
- Debugging
- Exceptions
- Creating a program with multiple functions 
           
### What I Found Challenging:  
- This problem was that bad. I didn't find it that challenging

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Finished Problem #1 from Problem Set 3 
    
### Resources Used:  
- [Problem Set 3](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/resources/ps3/)
  
### Reflections/Insights:
- For this problem, I tested each step as I went to make sure it was successful. I used the print statement a lot to make sure that I was getting the intended results. The assignment had us test the function with a test code to see if it was successful, and my function passed. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue with the MIT class online. 

### Code:
