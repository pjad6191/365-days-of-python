### Resources Used:  
- **ChatGPT**

### Reflections/Insights:
- I was struggling to find the sweet spot for challenge and practice with Pandas. I want to master the basics so that I don't feel like I'm guessing and hoping for the right result. That means I don't want advanced topics just yet, but don't want to be taught the same things over again. I tried using ChatGPT's tutoring feature. I told it what I wanted to practice and what I was struggling with, and it was exactly what I was looking for. The tutoring feature will not give you answers, but help you see where you are going wrong. It first quizzed me to see what I knew, and then when we got to an area where I was getting wrong answers, we spent time there, first making sure I understood the concepts and then practicing. I was very happy and felt like I made leaps and bounds in comfort. This is something I will probably come back to often. It was just the right amount of challenge and practice. I would highly recommended it! 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue practicing Pandas with ChatGPT.
