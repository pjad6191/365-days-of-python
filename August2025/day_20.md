## August 28, 2025 - Day 20

### What I Worked On:  
- I started kaggle's Data Cleaning course, but so far most of it seems like review. I also started exploring a dataset that I downloaded from kaggle. It was very clean to begin with, so it won't work for practicing data cleaning, but there are a lot of insights to be gained from it.  

### Concepts Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames**: 
    - Handling missing values
    - Beginning exploration of a data set 
       
### What I Found Challenging:  
- I didn't find anything particularly challenging today.  

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Began a new course
    
### Resources Used:  
- **ChatGPT**
- [**kaggle's Pandas Course**](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)
- **Data set: [Sleep Deprivation & Cognitive Performance**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sacramentotechnology/sleep-deprivation-and-cognitive-performance)

### Reflections/Insights:
- The dataset I started working with wery clean to begin with, so it won't work for practicing data cleaning, but there are a lot of insights to be gained from it. I can practice pulling the combinations that I want and just see where it goes. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue exploring the new dataset and continuting with the data cleaning course.
