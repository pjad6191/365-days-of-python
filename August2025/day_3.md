## August 11, 2025 - Day 3

### What I Worked On:  
- Watched **Lecture 5: Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning** from MIT's Open Courseware Class: **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**  
- Worked Dataframes Lab from the **Google Advanced Data Analytics** course. 

### Concepts Learned/Practiced:  
- **Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning** - Reviewed
- **Dataframe Masks**
  
### What I Found Challenging:  
- Keeping the parentheses vs brackets straight when calling up different sections of a dataframe. 

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Finished the next lecture in my online class
- Become more comfortable with Dataframe masks  
    
### Resources Used:  
- [MIT OCW 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)  
- [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)  

### Reflections/Insights:
- I would like to read more about Dataframes because I learn better through reading.    
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow:  
- Start the next lecture from the online class
- Read about Dataframes
- Start working on LeetCode
