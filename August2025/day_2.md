## August 10, 2025 - Day 2

### What I Worked On:  
- Finished up the Hangman game for Problem Set 2 from MIT's Open Courseware Class: **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**    
  - Finished up all the conditional statements  
  - Ran test cases  
  - Debugged problems   
- Watched videos on dataframes and Boolean masking through the **Google Advanced Data Analytics** course. 

### Concepts Learned/Practiced:  
- **Creating functions:** Added an additional helper function for hints in the Hangman game. 
- **Groupby()** and **arr()** functions in **Pandas**  
  
### What I Found Challenging:  
- - **Hangman Game:** Debugging. Sometimes it was hard to figure out why something wasn't working. It's usually something small but hard to find. 

### Key Accomplishments:  
- **Completed Hangman game:**   
    
### Resources Used:  
- [MIT OCW 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)  
- [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)  

### Reflections/Insights:
- Some parts of programming are easier as this isn't my first round of learning.    
- Although I can use ChatGPT to debug my programs, I refuse to at this point in time. I want to learn and discover on my own. I know that I will make mistakes, but that is how I will learn. I don't want shortcuts. I want to actually figure it out so that I can build up a base knowledge and experience.     

### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow:  
- Finish one more function for Problem Set 2.
- Watch more lectures from the online MIT course.
- Do a Dataframe Lab in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification course.
