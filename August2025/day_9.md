### Concepts Learned/Practiced:

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Got more hands on experience with DataFrames in Pandas
    
### Resources Used:

### Reflections/Insights:
- I continued with learning Pandas. I feel like this is important for data analysis, so I want to be very comfortable with it. It will be my concentration for the rest of the month. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue practicing selection in Pandas

### Sample Selecting & Indexing: 

```python

#Example summary functions:
median_points = reviews.points.median()
mean_points = reviews.points.me()

```
