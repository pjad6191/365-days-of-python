## August 26, 2025 - Day 18

### What I Worked On:  
- I finished two more sections of kaggle's Panda course. I only have one section left before I complete the course, and it seems easy. I should finish the course tomorrow. 

### Concepts Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames**: 
    - Data types 
    - Sorting Values
    - Grouping 
    - Missing Data 
       
### What I Found Challenging:  
- I was a little confused by groupby when you are focusing on a different aspect. For example, you group by country, but focus on the price aspect. It helps to print out each Series to see how each variation is organized.  

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Finished another 2 sections of the kaggle Pandas Course
    
### Resources Used:  
- **ChatGPT**
- [**kaggle's Pandas Course**](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

### Reflections/Insights:
- I feel good about what I have learned. I only had one small hiccup with the practice questions. The rest of the questions, I got easily. I have come a long way in two weeks. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Finish kaggle's Pandas course
