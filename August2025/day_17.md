## August 25, 2025 - Day 17

### What I Worked On:  
- Pandas with ChatGPT

### Concepts Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames**: Grouping and Sorting
          
### Resources Used:  
- **ChatGPT**
- **Kaggle**

### Reflections/Insights:
-   I am feeling a little frustrated today. Kaggle introduced some concepts that I don't feel ready for yet. I think I need to get a better grasp on what it's talking about. I am going to spend some time working through the examples it gave with ChatGPT. However, I am tired and just dropped one of my kids off at college, so I'm not going to go into depth tonight. I stuck with it, and worked a little on Python to keep my goal of 365 days of Python though.
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Practice kaggle examples with ChatGPT
