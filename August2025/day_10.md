### What I Worked On:  
- Continued with the kaggle course on Pandas 

### Concepts Learned/Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames: Groupby and Sorting**
       
### What I Found Challenging:  
- I am unfamiliar with the use of lambda. I had to spend some time researching that.  

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Got more hands on experience with DataFrames in Pandas
    
### Resources Used:  
- **[Kaggle's Pandas Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)**

### Reflections/Insights:
- No big insights. I want to look for more courses or practice questions to become comfortable with what I'm doing. I'm not going to get it after a couple days. I need more practice.  
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue practicing selection in Pandas
