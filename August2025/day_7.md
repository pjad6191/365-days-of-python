## August 15, 2025 - Day 7

### What I Worked On:  
- More DataFrames! I started a kaggle course on {andas DataFrames. I'm determined to be comfortable with them moving forward. I also created a bunch of mini practice DataFrames. 

### Concepts Learned/Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames: Creating, Reading, and Writing**
       
### What I Found Challenging:  
- I didn't find too much challenging today. I was just practicing. 

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Got more hands on experience with DataFrames in Pandas
    
### Resources Used:  
- **[Kaggle's Pandas Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)**
- **_Python for Data Analysis_** by Wes McKinney, Chapter 5 

### Reflections/Insights:
- We lost power for a good portion of the day, so I used it for some reading time  
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue practicing selection in Pandas

### Example Fun Kitty DataFrame: 

```python

import pandas as pd

cats = pd.DataFrame({"Color":["White", "Gray", "Black", "Tuxedo", "Tuxedo", "Tiger"], "Age":[18, 13, 11, 8, 8, 7], "Sex":["Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Male"]}, index = ["Nemo", "Max", "Bella", "Sam", "Muffin", "Ezra"])

print(cats)
```
