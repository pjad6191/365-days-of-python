## August 27, 2025 - Day 19

### What I Worked On:  
- I finished kaggle's Panda course. The last section was easy. Then I went on to work on creating pivot tables with chatGPT. I also downloaded a dataset to start practicing on my own projects. 

### Concepts Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames**: 
    - Renaming
    - Combining
    - Pivot Tables 
       
### What I Found Challenging:  
- I didn't find anything particularly challenging today.  

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Finished the pandas course on kaggle.
    
### Resources Used:  
- **ChatGPT**
- [**kaggle's Pandas Course**](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

### Reflections/Insights:
- I feel like I have come a long way and feel more ready to explore datasets on my own. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continue improving panda skills and start exploring a dataset. I plan to keep track of what I do with Jupyter.
