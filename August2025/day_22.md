## August 30, 2025 - Day 22

### What I Worked On:  
- I worked more on the Scaling and Normalization section of the kaggle course and supplemented with chatgpt to help me fill in concepts. I haven't worked much with graphing in Python yet, so this is what I'm concentrating on next. 
  
### Concepts Practiced:  
- **Pandas DataFrames**: 
    - Scaling and Normalization
    - Graphing
       
### What I Found Challenging:  
- Just learning new to me concepts
  
### Resources Used:  
- **ChatGPT**
- [**kaggle's Pandas Course**](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)

### Reflections/Insights:
- It's been a long week, so I haven't put as much time into this as I'd like but I have some days off for the next two days with an extended weekend. Hoping to put some solid time into it. 
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow: 
- Continuting with the data cleaning course.
