## August 12, 2025 - Day 4

### What I Worked On:  
- Watched **Lecture 6: Recursion, Dictionaries** from MIT's Open Courseware Class: **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**  
- Read ch 4-5 of **_Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_** by John Guttag.
- Started working on the problems in **LeetCode's Introduction to Pandas**

### Concepts Learned/Practiced:  
- **Recursion**
- **Dictionaries**
- **Creating DataFrames** in **Pandas**
  
### What I Found Challenging:  
- Recursion was a little confusing at first. The instructor in the video went over two examples of using recursion for cases of Fibonacci numbers and Palindromes. He went over it quickly, but I stopped the video to work through the functions on my own to understand what was going on. 

### Key Accomplishments:  
- Started working on LeetCode and got more hands on experience with DataFrames 
    
### Resources Used:  
- [MIT OCW 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)  
- **_Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_** by John Guttag.

### Reflections/Insights:
- I want to work a lot on DataFrames until creating them and using them are easy. That is going to be my goal for the rest of the month.    
  
### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow:  
- Read ch. 6
- Watch the next lecture
- Continue working on LeetCode
