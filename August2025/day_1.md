## August 9, 2025 - Day 1

### What I Worked On:  
- Finished up Problem Set 1 and began Problem Set 2 from MIT's Open Courseware Class: **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**  
  - Worked on creating a **bisection search** for Problem Set 1 to solve how much to save each month to afford a down payment in 36 months.  
  - Started working on a **Hangman game** for Problem Set 2, focusing on conditionals and game logic.   
- Watched videos on numpy and pandas through the Google Advanced Data Analytics course and completed hands on labs using **NumPy** and **Pandas.**  
- Created an account on **LeetCode** to practice **Pandas** and algorithm challegnges.
- Watched **Day 1: Line continuation characters in Python** from **Python Coding (CLCODING)**.

### Concepts Learned/Practiced:  
- **Conditionals and Loops:** if statements, while statements, for loops  
- **String Formatting and String Manipulation:** Formatting user input and processing strings.   
- **Bisection Search:** Used this search technique in Problem Set 1 to figure out the percentage of monthly salary needed to save each month for a down payment by after 36 months.   

### What I Found Challenging:  
- **Bisection Search** - I struggled with getting the bisection search to work. I knew what I wanted to do, but the challenge was in making it work. I was initially using **Visual Studio**, but then switched to **Spyder** for its helpful error labeling feature. This made it easier to debug syntax issues.   
- **Hangman Game:** The requirements for the Hangman game involve a lot of conditionals. While the first part of the game was easy, I got tired of doing all the conditionals and decided to switch to something else for the time being. I'll pick back up on it tomorrow.   

### Key Accomplishments:  
- **Completed Problem Set 1:** I created a program that calculates how much money to save each month to afford a down payment for a house in 3 months. This involved applying basic math and bisection search.  
- **Started Problem Set 2:** Began working on a Hangman game and improved my understanding of strings and conditionals.     
 
### Resources Used:  
- [MIT OCW 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)  
- [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/)
- [Day 1: Line continuation characters in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd6-4WhTpkg&list=PLeLGx0BaYD6Zr_3ReRhyZHLoO35uEVmcJ&index=192)  

### Reflections/Insights:
- I need to work on understanding **flow control** better, especially for large programs like the Hangman game. I think it’ll get easier as I work with more complex code.   
- I’m excited to see how quickly I can improve with consistent practice. I’m feeling motivated to keep building on what I’ve learned.   

### Next Steps/Plans for Tomorrow:  
- Finish Problem Set 2   
- Wrap up Module 4 in the Course "Getting Starting with Python" through the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification
