## October 31, 2025 - Day 84

### What I Worked On:  
**Exercism:**  
It's Halloween, and not much time to code today, but I still did one quick Exercism problem. 

I also worked on a short quick function dealing with time. 

### Concept Practiced:  
- Dealing with optional/built in parameter
         
### Resources Used:  
- [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises)
    
### Exercism Code: 
```python
def two_fer(name="you"):
    """
    The function determines what you will say when you give away a cookie. 
    If you know the person, you will say 'One for you'. 
    Otherwise you will use the name given.
    """
    
    return f"One for {name}, one for me."
   
    
```
